# Go bindings to the EFL.

This repository contains a cgo-based binding to the [EFL][1]. This is
very incomplete -- don't expect much just yet.

The `examples` directory contains some sample applications (well, just
one so far).

The binding is go-gettable. The only non-go dependencies are the EFL and
pkg-config.

# Go bindings to the EFL.

This repository contains the beginnings of a cgo-based binding to the [EFL][1].
This startred as a late night diversion, and I haven't really revisited it. Don't
expect much, this is very incomplete.

The `examples` directory contains some sample applications (well, just
one so far).

The binding is go-gettable. The only non-go dependencies are the EFL and
pkg-config.
